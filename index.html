            Bugema University holds as its philosophy the belief that true education fosters 
            the restoration of the lost image of God in human beings through the harmonious 
            development of the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of life. 
            The philosophy is manifested in the “3H” program of the University curriculum, 
            which emphasizes the learners, balanced and positive development of the Head, 
            Heart, and Hand as they prepare for service here and for life in the hereafter.
            Bugema University envisions training for “Excellence in Service”

    <h3>
        <p>THE REASON WHY I JOINED BUGEMA UNIVESRITY</p>
    </h3>
    <p> I chose this University because of highly rated [area of study program]. 
        I've had a passion for this field for a long time by my brother and I'm excited 
        to learn from this faculty of Bussiness Computing that have built such a great program. 
        I think my skills and learning style will be a great fit for the program.</p>
